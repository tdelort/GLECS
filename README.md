# GLECS

A collection of classes and methods I developped to make my life easier when using OpenGL

## Conventions

Just to make my life easier and so that I don't need to look everywhere to find them, here is a small list of conventions I use:  

`camelCase` for functions  
`snake_case` for variables and namespaces  
`PascalCase` for classes  

Most classes will be found in the `nbop::glecs` namespace.

## Concessions

Since it will mostly used with OpenGL, I will use `glm` structures and functions to represent vectors, matrices, etc, instead of implementing them myself.
